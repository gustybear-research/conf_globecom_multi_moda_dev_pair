However, current remote unattended sleep studies are mostly contact sensor based and test results are sometimes falsified by sleep-critical job holders (driver, airline pilots) due to fear of potential job loss. In this work, we investigated identity authentication of patients with OSA symptoms based on extracting respiratory features (peak power spectral density, packing density and linear envelop error) from radar captured paradoxical breathing patterns in a small-scale clinical sleep study integrating three different machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Knearest neighbor (KNN), Random forest). The proposed OSAbased authentication method was tested and validated for five OSA patients with 93.75\% accuracy using KNN classifier which outperformed other classifiers.},

Many techniques and automated systems have been developed over the past few decades; each has its own advantages and limitations. There are often trade-offs amongst reliability, the ease of use, ethical/human rights issues, and acceptability in a particular application. Multimodal identification and authentication can, to some extent, alleviate the dilemmas and improve the overall performance. This paper proposes a new method of the combined use of signatures and utterances of pronounced names to identify or authenticate persons. Unlike typical signature verification methods, the dynamic features of signatures are captured as sound in this paper. The multimodal approach shows increased reliability, providing a relatively simple and potentially useful method for person identification and authentication.},

These frames are compared to training frames using normalized correlation, and subject classiﬁcation is performed by nearest neighbor matching among correlation scores. The approach implicitly captures biometric shape cues such as body height, width, and body-part proportions, as well as gait cues such as stride length and amount of arm swing.

With a view to exploiting the complementary nature of different modes of information and increasing pattern recognition robustness to test signal degradation, we developed a multiple expert biometric person identification system that combines information from three experts: face, visual speech, and audio. The system uses multimodal fusion in an automatic unsupervised manner, adapting to the local performance and output reliability of each of the experts. The expert weightings are chosen automatically such that the reliability measure of the combined scores is maximized. To test system robustness to train/test mismatch, we used a broad range of Gaussian noise and JPEG compression to degrade the audio and visual signals, respectively. Experiments were carried out on the XM2VTS database. The multimodal expert system out performed each of the single experts in all comparisons. At severe audio and visual mismatch levels tested, the audio, mouth, face, and tri-expert fusion accuracies were 37.1\%, 48\%, 75\%, and 92.7\% respectively, representing a relative improvement of 23.6\% over the best performing expert.},

To extract features from voice signals, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) technique was applied producing a set of feature vectors. Subsequently, the system uses the Vector Quantization (VQ) for features training and classification. In order to train and test the developed automatic person identification system, an in-house voice database is created, which contains recordings of 100 persons’ usernames (50 males and 50 females) each of which is repeated 30 times. Therefore, a total of 3000 utterances are collected. This paper also investigates the effect of the persons’ gender on the overall performance of the system. The voice data collected from female persons outperformed those collected from the male persons, whereby the system obtained average recognition rates of 94.20\% and 91.00\% for female and male persons, respectively. Overall, the voice based system obtained an average recognition rate of 92.60\% for all persons.},

Our work extends past approaches of using wireless signals for respiratory monitoring by using only a single transmitter-receiver pair at the same frequency range of commodity Wi-Fi signals to estimate the respiratory rate of an individual. This is done irrespective of whether they are in line of sight or not (e.g., through walls). Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of WiBreathe in detecting multiple people and by extension, their respiration rates. We evaluate our approach in various natural environments and show that we can track breathing with the accuracy of 1.54 breaths per minute when compared to a clinical respiratory chest band.},

	title = {Continuous {User} {Veriﬁcation} via {Respiratory} {Biometrics}},
	abstract = {The ever-growing security issues in various mobile applications and smart devices create an urgent demand for a reliable and convenient user veriﬁcation method. Traditional veriﬁcation methods request users to provide their secrets (e.g., entering passwords and collecting ﬁngerprints). We envision that the essential trend of user veriﬁcation is to free users from active participation in the veriﬁcation process. Toward this end, we propose a continuous user veriﬁcation system, which re-uses the widely deployed WiFi infrastructure to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in user’s respiratory motions. Different from the existing continuous veriﬁcation approaches, posing dependency on restricted scenarios/user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits), our system can be easily integrated into any WiFi infrastructure to provide non-intrusive continuous veriﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we extract the respirationrelated signals from the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. We then derive the user-speciﬁc respiratory features based on the waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of the respiration signals. Additionally, a deep learning based user veriﬁcation scheme is developed to identify legitimate users accurately and detect the existence of spooﬁng attacks. Extensive experiments involving 20 participants demonstrate that the proposed system can robustly verify/identify users and detect spoofers under various types of attacks.},

	abstract = {A non-contact and non-invasive physiological radar monitoring system (PRMS) is introduced. The system is based on motion detection using quadrature microwave Doppler radar, eliminating the need to place sensors on the body. An algorithm was designed to perform real-time actigraphy and sleep apnea detection. The system was validated with clinical polysomnography (PSG) in a sleep study facility on ten consented volunteers with known obstructive sleep apnea. Data obtained from both PRMS and clinical PSG systems were rated by a sleep technician and show an excellent agreement in the detected apnea and hypopnea events. The apnea-hypopnea events were distinguished with an overall sensitivity of 86\%, the speciﬁcity of 91\% and accuracy of 92\%.},

	abstract = {While non-contact monitoring of human respiration has been demonstrated using Doppler radar, the concurrent monitoring of multiple equidistant subjects remains a signiﬁcant technological challenge. Reported research has so far been limited to maintaining 1-m subject separation, based on the radar antenna beam-width. Proposed here is a hybrid method consisting of an SNR-based intelligent decision algorithm which integrates two different approaches to isolate respiratory signatures of two subjects within the radar beam-width separated by less than 1 meter. Using Independent Component Analysis with the JADE algorithm (ICA-JADE) and Direction of Arrival (DOA), this SNR-based decision algorithm works with an accuracy above 93\%. In addition, angular location of each subject is estimated by phase-comparison monopulse and an integrated beam switching capability is demonstrated to optimally extract respiratory information. The proposed method coherently combines two separation methods to overcome multiple-subject monitoring limits which can lead to practical adoption for many respiration monitoring applications.},

Existing efforts have investigated the privacy leakage behaviors of mobile ad networks. However, there lacks a large-scale measurement study to evaluate the scale of privacy leakage through mobile ads. In this work, we present a study of the potential privacy leakage in location-based mobile advertising services based on a large-scale measurement. We first introduce a threat model in the mobile ad ecosystem, and then design a measurement system to perform extensive threat measurements and assessments. To counteract the privacy leakage threats, we design and implement an adaptive location obfuscation mechanism, which can be used to obfuscate location data in real-time while minimizing the impact to mobile ad businesses.},

Smart city applications focus on resolving issues facing people in everyday life, and have attracted a considerable amount of research interest. The typical issue encountered in such places of daily use, such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd dynamics management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd dynamics management can be achieved by gathering information relating to congestion and propose less crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics management applications have been proposed in various scenarios and many models have been devised to this end, a general model for evaluating the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet been developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications. In other words, the objective of this paper is to present the proof-of-concept of control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management. Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables an integrated evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management methods under various scenarios. We also provide extensive numerical results to verify the effectiveness of the model.},

  abstract = {Context-based pairing solutions increase the usability of IoT device pairing by eliminating any human involvement in the pairing process. This is possible by utilizing on-board sensors (with same sensing modalities) to capture a common physical context (e.g., ambient sound via each device’s microphone). However, in a smart home scenario, it is impractical to assume that all devices will share a common sensing modality. For example, a motion detector is only equipped with an infrared sensor while Amazon Echo only has microphones. In this paper, we develop a new context-based pairing mechanism called Perceptio that uses time as the common factor across differing sensor types. By focusing on the event timing, rather than the specific event sensor data, Perceptio creates event fingerprints that can be matched across a variety of IoT devices. We propose Perceptio based on the idea that devices co-located within a physically secure boundary (e.g., single family house) can observe more events in common over time, as opposed to devices outside. Devices make use of the observed contextual information to provide entropy for Perceptio’s pairing protocol. We design and implement Perceptio, and evaluate its effectiveness as an autonomous secure pairing solution. Our implementation demonstrates the ability to sufficiently distinguish between legitimate devices (placed within the boundary) and attacker devices (placed outside) by imposing a threshold on fingerprint similarity. Perceptio demonstrates an average fingerprint similarity of 94.9\% between legitimate devices while even a hypothetical impossibly well-performing attacker yields only 68.9\% between itself and a valid device.},

  abstract = {The ever-growing security issues in various mobile applications and smart devices create an urgent demand for a reliable and convenient user verification method. Traditional verification methods request users to provide their secrets (e.g., entering passwords and collecting fingerprints). We envision that the essential trend of user verification is to free users from active participation in the verification process. Toward this end, we propose a continuous user verification system, which re-uses the widely deployed WiFi infrastructure to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in user’s respiratory motions. Different from the existing continuous verification approaches, posing dependency on restricted scenarios/user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits), our system can be easily integrated into any WiFi infrastructure to provide non-intrusive continuous verification. Specifically, we extract the respirationrelated signals from the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. We then derive the user-specific respiratory features based on the waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of the respiration signals. Additionally, a deep learning based user verification scheme is developed to identify legitimate users accurately and detect the existence of spoofing attacks. Extensive experiments involving 20 participants demonstrate that the proposed system can robustly verify/identify users and detect spoofers under various types of attacks.},

The rate at which the secret bits are generated, however, depends heavily on how fast the channel changes. As a result, existing schemes have a low secrecy rate and are mainly applicable to mobile environments. In contrast, this paper presents a new physical-layer approach to secret key generation that is both fast and independent of channel variations. Our approach makes a receiver jam the signal in a manner that still allows it to decode the data, yet prevents other nodes from decoding. Results from a testbed implementation show that our method is significantly faster and more accurate than state of the art physical-layer secret key generation protocols. Specifically, while past work generates up to 44 secret bits/s with a 4\% bit disagreement between the two devices, our design has a secrecy rate of 3\textendash 18 Kb/s with 0\% bit disagreement.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the ability to digitize physical objects into virtual data, thanks to the integration of hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and network communications for collecting and exchanging data. In this digitization process, however, security challenges need to be taken into account in order to prevent information availability, integrity, and confidentiality from being compromised. In this paper, security challenges of two broadly used technologies, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and Bluetooth, are analyzed. First, a review of the main vulnerabilities, security risk, and threats affecting both technologies are carried out. Then, open hardware and open source tools like: Proxmark3 and Ubertooth as well as BtleJuice and Bleah are used as part of the practical analysis. Lastly, risk mitigation and counter measures are proposed.},
