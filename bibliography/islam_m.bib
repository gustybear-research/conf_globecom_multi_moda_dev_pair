	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea which is defined as the suspension of breathing. OSA is generally caused by complete or partial obstruction of airway during sleep, making the breathing pattern irregular and abnormal for prolonged periods of time. Apnea can contribute to a variety of life threatening medical conditions, and can be deadly if left untreated. Nowadays, out of 18 to 50 million people in the US, most cases remain undiagnosed due to the cost, cumbersome and resource limitations of overnight polysomnography (PSG) at sleep labs. Currently PSG relies on a doctor’s experience. In order to improve the medical service efficiency, reduce diagnosis time and ensure a more accurate diagnosis, a quantitative and objective method is needed.},

The goal of this work is to investigate a trustworthy, continuous, and noncontact user authentication approach based on a heart-related biometric that works in a daily-life environment. To this end, we present a novel, continuous authentication system, namely Cardiac Scan, based on geometric and non-volitional features of the cardiac motion. Cardiac motion is an automatic heart deformation caused by self-excitement of the cardiac muscle, which is unique to each user and is difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit. Cardiac Scan features intrinsic liveness detection, unobtrusiveness, cost-effectiveness, and high usability. We prototype a remote, highresolution cardiac motion sensing system based on the smart DCcoupled continuous-wave radar. Fiducial-based invariant identity descriptors of cardiac motion are extracted after the radar signal demodulation. We conduct a pilot study with 78 subjects to evaluate Cardiac Scan in accuracy, authentication time, permanence, evaluation in complex conditions, and vulnerability. Specifically, Cardiac Scan achieves 98.61\% balanced accuracy (BAC) and 4.42\% equal error rate (EER) in a real-world setup. We demonstrate that Cardiac Scan is a robust and usable continuous authentication system.},

This paper investigates a technique to attain the requisite signal to noise ratio by dc offset management. Detailed exploration of the unique features in respiration signals using noncontact CW Doppler radar are presented. A proposed dynamic segmentation technique allowed detection of various unique features and patterns. KMN nearest neighbor and majority vote algorithms were implemented in software for this radar-based unique identiﬁcation system. The system was tested and validated for six test subjects with 95\% success rate. Fractal analysis of minor components of linearly demodulated radar signal was also presented for additional improvement in accuracy.

Besides this diversity, in every recording of ventilation at rest in steady-state condition breath-tobreath ﬂuctuations are observed in ventilatory variables. This variability is non random and may be explained either by a central neural mechanism or by instability in the chemical feedback loops. Beyond this variability, each individual appears to select one particular pattern among the inﬁnite number of possible combination of ventilatory variables and airﬂow proﬁle. This one particular pattern appears to be a relatively stable characteristic of an adult individual being reproducible in several conditions and above all, after a long period of time. Consequences of this individuality of breathing pattern are discussed with regard to the selection of control subjects for a study and also per se: are there physiological situations where differences may be observed solely because of the differences in the pattern of breathing? © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Respiration monitoring using microwave Doppler radar has attracted significant interest over the last four decades due to its non-invasive and non-contact form of measurement. However, this technology is still not at the level of practical implementations in healthcare due to motion artifacts and interference from multiple subjects within the range of the Doppler radar sensor. Most reported results in literature focus only on single subject measurements because when multiple subjects are present there are interfering respiration signals which are difficult to separate as individual respiration signals. This paper investigates the feasibility of separating respiratory signatures from the multiple subjects. We employed a new approach using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with the Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eignematrices (JADE) algorithm to achieve this for closely spaced subjects, and the system is also capable of estimating Direction of Arrival (DOA) for well-spaced subjects. Experimental results demonstrated that the ICA-JADE method can separate respiratory signatures from two subjects one meter apart from each other at a distance from the radar of 2.89 meters. The separated respiratory pattern closely correlates with reference chest belt respiration patterns, and the mean square error is approximately 11.58\%. Concisely, this paper clearly demonstrates that by integrating ICA with the JADE algorithm in a Doppler radar physiological monitoring system, multiple subjects can be monitored simultaneously.},

In this paper, we employed a new, cost effective and scalable approach for estimating Direction of Arrival (DOA) to separate well-spaced multiple subjects by introducing a 24-GHz phase comparison monopulse radar in our system. Experimental results demonstrated that phase comparison technique can separate two subjects 1.5 meters apart from each other at a distance of 3 meters from the sensor and it can estimate the angular position of single subject with respect to the radar. It also illustrates that the phase-comparison technique is computationally faster and requires fewer snapshots or samples than the well-established MUSIC algorithm. Our experimental results also demonstrate that the monopulse technique for multiple subject measurement has estimation accuracy of almost 80\%. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of using a phasecomparison monopulse technique to separate well-spaced subjects based on estimation of the angle of physiological signals, which will lead to practical adoption of this technology in our daily life.},

A mechanical target was used to provide sufﬁcient motion to create a signiﬁcant segment of an ellipse in the in-phase/quadrature trace to obtain correction factors with high accuracy. Parametric simulations were performed to analyze the accuracy of this technique in the presence of varying noise and target displacements. This method is compared with an existing phase-shifter-based imbalance computation technique for the measurement of known displacements and is shown to give consistent and more accurate results. Experimental data, consistent with simulations, demonstrates that accurate correction is obtained with 65\% of the ellipse, resulting in a displacement error of less than 6\%.},

However, current remote unattended sleep studies are mostly contact sensor based and test results are sometimes falsified by sleep-critical job holders (driver, airline pilots) due to fear of potential job loss. In this work, we investigated identity authentication of patients with OSA symptoms based on extracting respiratory features (peak power spectral density, packing density and linear envelop error) from radar captured paradoxical breathing patterns in a small-scale clinical sleep study integrating three different machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Knearest neighbor (KNN), Random forest). The proposed OSAbased authentication method was tested and validated for five OSA patients with 93.75\% accuracy using KNN classifier which outperformed other classifiers.},

Many techniques and automated systems have been developed over the past few decades; each has its own advantages and limitations. There are often trade-offs amongst reliability, the ease of use, ethical/human rights issues, and acceptability in a particular application. Multimodal identification and authentication can, to some extent, alleviate the dilemmas and improve the overall performance. This paper proposes a new method of the combined use of signatures and utterances of pronounced names to identify or authenticate persons. Unlike typical signature verification methods, the dynamic features of signatures are captured as sound in this paper. The multimodal approach shows increased reliability, providing a relatively simple and potentially useful method for person identification and authentication.},

With a view to exploiting the complementary nature of different modes of information and increasing pattern recognition robustness to test signal degradation, we developed a multiple expert biometric person identification system that combines information from three experts: face, visual speech, and audio. The system uses multimodal fusion in an automatic unsupervised manner, adapting to the local performance and output reliability of each of the experts. The expert weightings are chosen automatically such that the reliability measure of the combined scores is maximized. To test system robustness to train/test mismatch, we used a broad range of Gaussian noise and JPEG compression to degrade the audio and visual signals, respectively. Experiments were carried out on the XM2VTS database. The multimodal expert system out performed each of the single experts in all comparisons. At severe audio and visual mismatch levels tested, the audio, mouth, face, and tri-expert fusion accuracies were 37.1\%, 48\%, 75\%, and 92.7\% respectively, representing a relative improvement of 23.6\% over the best performing expert.},

To extract features from voice signals, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) technique was applied producing a set of feature vectors. Subsequently, the system uses the Vector Quantization (VQ) for features training and classification. In order to train and test the developed automatic person identification system, an in-house voice database is created, which contains recordings of 100 persons’ usernames (50 males and 50 females) each of which is repeated 30 times. Therefore, a total of 3000 utterances are collected. This paper also investigates the effect of the persons’ gender on the overall performance of the system. The voice data collected from female persons outperformed those collected from the male persons, whereby the system obtained average recognition rates of 94.20\% and 91.00\% for female and male persons, respectively. Overall, the voice based system obtained an average recognition rate of 92.60\% for all persons.},

Our work extends past approaches of using wireless signals for respiratory monitoring by using only a single transmitter-receiver pair at the same frequency range of commodity Wi-Fi signals to estimate the respiratory rate of an individual. This is done irrespective of whether they are in line of sight or not (e.g., through walls). Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of WiBreathe in detecting multiple people and by extension, their respiration rates. We evaluate our approach in various natural environments and show that we can track breathing with the accuracy of 1.54 breaths per minute when compared to a clinical respiratory chest band.},

	abstract = {The ever-growing security issues in various mobile applications and smart devices create an urgent demand for a reliable and convenient user veriﬁcation method. Traditional veriﬁcation methods request users to provide their secrets (e.g., entering passwords and collecting ﬁngerprints). We envision that the essential trend of user veriﬁcation is to free users from active participation in the veriﬁcation process. Toward this end, we propose a continuous user veriﬁcation system, which re-uses the widely deployed WiFi infrastructure to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in user’s respiratory motions. Different from the existing continuous veriﬁcation approaches, posing dependency on restricted scenarios/user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits), our system can be easily integrated into any WiFi infrastructure to provide non-intrusive continuous veriﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we extract the respirationrelated signals from the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. We then derive the user-speciﬁc respiratory features based on the waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of the respiration signals. Additionally, a deep learning based user veriﬁcation scheme is developed to identify legitimate users accurately and detect the existence of spooﬁng attacks. Extensive experiments involving 20 participants demonstrate that the proposed system can robustly verify/identify users and detect spoofers under various types of attacks.},

	abstract = {A non-contact and non-invasive physiological radar monitoring system (PRMS) is introduced. The system is based on motion detection using quadrature microwave Doppler radar, eliminating the need to place sensors on the body. An algorithm was designed to perform real-time actigraphy and sleep apnea detection. The system was validated with clinical polysomnography (PSG) in a sleep study facility on ten consented volunteers with known obstructive sleep apnea. Data obtained from both PRMS and clinical PSG systems were rated by a sleep technician and show an excellent agreement in the detected apnea and hypopnea events. The apnea-hypopnea events were distinguished with an overall sensitivity of 86\%, the speciﬁcity of 91\% and accuracy of 92\%.},

Of the many algorithms available to compute ICA parameters, the Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices (JADE) algorithm is presented here in detail. Three examples are used to illustrate its performance, and highlight the differences between ICA results and those of other methods, such as Principal Components Analysis. A comparison with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) is also presented in the case of a three-way data set to show that ICA applied on an unfolded high-order array can give results comparable with those of PARAFAC.},

	abstract = {Direct-conversion microwave Doppler radar can be used to detect cardiopulmonary activity at a distance. One challenge for such detection in single channel receivers is demodulation sensitivity to target position, which can be overcome by using a quadrature receiver. This paper presents a mathematical analysis and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of arctangent demodulation in quadrature receivers. A particular challenge in this technique is the presence of dc offset resulting from receiver imperfections and clutter reﬂections, in addition to dc information related to target position and associated phase. These dc components can be large compared to the ac motion-related signal, and thus, cannot simply be included in digitization without adversely affecting resolution. Presented here is a method for calibrating the dc offset while preserving the dc information and capturing the motion-related signal with maximum resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that arctangent demodulation with dc offset compensation results in a signiﬁcant improvement in heart rate measurement accuracy over quadrature channel selection, with a standard deviation of less than 1 beat/min.},

	abstract = {While non-contact monitoring of human respiration has been demonstrated using Doppler radar, the concurrent monitoring of multiple equidistant subjects remains a signiﬁcant technological challenge. Reported research has so far been limited to maintaining 1-m subject separation, based on the radar antenna beam-width. Proposed here is a hybrid method consisting of an SNR-based intelligent decision algorithm which integrates two different approaches to isolate respiratory signatures of two subjects within the radar beam-width separated by less than 1 meter. Using Independent Component Analysis with the JADE algorithm (ICA-JADE) and Direction of Arrival (DOA), this SNR-based decision algorithm works with an accuracy above 93\%. In addition, angular location of each subject is estimated by phase-comparison monopulse and an integrated beam switching capability is demonstrated to optimally extract respiratory information. The proposed method coherently combines two separation methods to overcome multiple-subject monitoring limits which can lead to practical adoption for many respiration monitoring applications.},
